# osu-warp
Currently WIP Discord bot to estimate osu!WAR

To run, import disnake if you haven't already, and create a .env file containing your Discord bot token ('DISCORD_TOKEN') and osu! API keys ('OSU_API_KEY').
Additionally, modify the testing_guild parameter to include your own server's ID, or comment out the line entirely.
