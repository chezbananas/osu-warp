# osu-warp
Small discord bot to estimate wins above replacement for osu! tournament matches, written to learn more about disnake and coding Discord Bots.

To run, import disnake if you haven't already, and create a .env file containing your Discord bot token ('DISCORD_TOKEN') and osu! API keys ('OSU_API_KEY').
Additionally, modify the testing_guild parameter to include your own server's ID, or comment out the line entirely.
